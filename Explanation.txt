Hello,
     Thank you for reviewing my code. The purpose of this project to build a simple Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP (LEMP) server and display the current time and external IP address.
I chose to use the default index.html file of the nginx server to place my results. To view the results, simply browse to http://172.17.2.18 after the vagrant box is brought up.
You can also view the results by inspecting /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html.
Additionally, I have included a simple bash script to write out to the same index file to fully meet the requirements of the challenge and could have used the script module to run the command. 
However, I chose to use Ansible modules and variables to display additional skills. 

The versions of VirtualBox and Vagrant that I used in my testing environment are listed below.

Vagrant Version: Vagrant 1.8.5
VirtualBox Version: 5.0.20r106931

Regards,
Ben Tennant
